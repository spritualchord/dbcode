Q1
Create Table with relevant constraints-
CREATE TABLE Department (
    DepNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Location VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    MgrID INT
);

CREATE TABLE Worker (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    JoiningDate DATE NOT NULL,
    DepartmentNo INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentNo) REFERENCES Department(DepNo)
);

-- Populating Department table
INSERT INTO Department (DepNo, DName, Location, MgrID) VALUES
(1, 'IT', 'New York', 101),
(2, 'Finance', 'London', 102),
(3, 'HR', 'Paris', 103),
(4, 'Marketing', 'Tokyo', 104),
(5, 'Sales', 'Sydney', 105);

-- Populating Worker table
INSERT INTO Worker (ID, Name, Salary, JoiningDate, DepartmentNo) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 50000, '2022-01-15', 1),
(2, 'Alice Smith', 60000, '2021-08-20', 2),
(3, 'Mike Johnson', 55000, '2020-11-10', 1),
(4, 'Jessica Brown', 62000, '2023-03-25', 4),
(5, 'Mark Taylor', 58000, '2022-06-30', 3);

Query to select distinct-
SELECT DISTINCT Location FROM Department;

 Query to display the Department Name, No. of Employees, and the average salary for all employees in that department:
SELECT d.DName AS Department_Name, COUNT(w.ID) AS No_of_Employees, AVG(w.Salary) AS Average_Salary
FROM Department d
LEFT JOIN Worker w ON d.DepNo = w.DepartmentNo
GROUP BY d.DepNo;

 Query to display Name with the 1st letter capitalized and all other letter lowercase and length of their name of all the workers whose name starts with ‘J’, ’A’ and ‘M’
SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTRING(Name, 1, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(Name, 2))) AS Formatted_Name, LENGTH(Name) AS Name_Length
FROM Worker
WHERE Name LIKE 'J%' OR Name LIKE 'A%' OR Name LIKE 'M%';
